Wire48 has a matrix server at https://mtx.wire48.net
The name of the deployment is @wire48.net

The server requires a [wire48.net account]({{< ref "/idp" >}}).
All users will be allocated users based on that account and 
will require a client. I suggest starting with 
https://app.element.io to get started.

The server participates in federation. If you do not have
a wire48 account you may still join in at:

#wire48@wire48.net
