The wiki is currently down. I wasn't satisfied with mediawiki due to its
second class support of postgresql. I want to homogonize on a single 
database platform. Therefore it's down until I can find one that meets
those requirements.

The wiki is at https://wiki.wire48.net. The wiki is used to collect and
develop ideas and techniques. It also functions as a collaboration space. It is
private and requires a [wire48.net account]({{< ref "/idp" >}}).
