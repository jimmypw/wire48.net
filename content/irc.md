There is a publicly accessable IRC server that I sometimes link projects up to.

`irc.wire48.net port 6697 (tls)`

The main room is `#wire48`

## Documentation

If you're new to IRC then i suggest checking out the guides on
[libera.chat](https://libera.chat/guides/) that should get you started. Then
just dive in.

## Bouncer

There is an [IRC Bouncer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)#IRC)
available on
https://bouncer.wire48.net:8099 using [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC). I use to
bring a little bit of persistence to IRC. I'm the only user but im not opposed
to others using it.
